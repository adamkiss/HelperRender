# Render:: v0.8.0

This is is simple module, that autoloads a single static class Master::, which then gives programmer access to simpler work with templates: `view loading`, `stylesheets and scripts loading`, `template stacking` and else.

## Why?

I despise dealing with templates (as in: html templates) in ProcessWire templates. Loading the correct JS only for some pages, loading different stylesheets and else... It's just not nice. Changing PW to RoR, so to speak (full object way) turned out to be too much of a hassle, as I'm sure I'll publish sometime, so I'm trying something else.

## Documentation?

Documentation seems to be the last thing missing :) Working on it.
